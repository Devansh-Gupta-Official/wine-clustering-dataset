# K-Means Clustering Analysis
This repository contains Python code for performing K-Means Clustering on a dataset and visualizing the clusters.

## **Dataset**
The analysis is conducted on the 'wine-clustering.csv' dataset.

# **Steps Involved**
1. Importing the Dataset: Load the dataset using pandas and prepare the data for clustering.
2. Determining Optimal Clusters: Utilize the Elbow Method to find the optimal number of clusters using within-cluster sum of squares (WCSS).
3. Training the K-Means Model: Implement K-Means Clustering with the optimal number of clusters.
4. Visualizing the Clusters: Plot the clusters and centroids using matplotlib to understand the groupings.
5. Silhouette Score: Calculate the silhouette score to evaluate the quality of clustering (optional step).

## **Usage**
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Ensure the wine-clustering.csv file is available in your repository.
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook file in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
4. Run the cells sequentially to observe each step's output and analysis.
5. Customize the model by adjusting parameters, exploring different evaluation metrics, or using other datasets.

## **Results**
The silhouette score is a metric used to assess the quality of clusters created by a clustering algorithm, such as K-Means. It measures how close each point in one cluster is to the points in the neighboring clusters. The score ranges from -1 to 1, where:

A score close to +1 suggests that the points are well-clustered, with distinct and well-separated clusters.
A score around 0 indicates overlapping clusters.
A score close to -1 suggests that the data might have been assigned to the wrong clusters.
In your case, achieving a silhouette score of 0.4247 is a positive sign. It suggests that the clusters formed have a reasonable degree of separation and are cohesive within themselves. However, the interpretation of this score might vary based on the context of your dataset and its inherent characteristics.

Elaborating further, a score of **0.4247** generally indicates that there is a moderate level of separation between clusters, meaning the clustering algorithm has succeeded in identifying somewhat distinct groupings within the data. The clusters might not be perfectly separated, but they are still reasonably well-defined.
